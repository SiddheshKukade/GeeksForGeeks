// This code is defining a function called inv that takes a single argument r of type long long int and returns a value of type long long.
// The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the inverse of r modulo mod, which is a global variable defined at the beginning of the code with the value 1000000007.
// The inverse of a number a modulo m is the number b such that (a * b) % m = 1. In this case, the function is trying to find the value of b such that (r * b) % mod = 1.
// The function uses a recursive approach to solve this equation, starting with the base case r == 1, in which it returns 1. If r is not 1, the function returns mod - ((mod / r) * inv(mod % r)) % mod + mod) % mod, which is a recursive call to inv with the argument mod % r.
// This recursive approach is based on the extended Euclidean algorithm, which is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers and can also be used to find the inverse of a number modulo m if a and m are relatively prime.
// Keep in mind that this function assumes that r and mod are relatively prime. If they are not, the inverse will not exist and the function will not return the correct result.
